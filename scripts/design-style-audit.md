# Design & Style Audit

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the codebase focusing on design patterns, architecture, and style conventions. It highlights consistency, best practices, and opportunities for improvement.

## 1. Architecture & Folder Structure

- **Consistent Module Grouping**: Core modules are organized under `src/` into logical directories: `components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`, `styles/`, `types/`, `utils/`.
- **Entry Points**: `index.tsx` bootstraps the app; routing is minimal and located in `App.tsx`.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Consider adding a `pages/` directory for top-level screens to clearly separate page-level and shared components.
  - Review the `motion/` and `rendering/` folders for overlapâ€”consolidate if redundant.

## 2. Component Design & Naming

- **Functional Components**: All React components use functional style with hooks.
- **Naming Conventions**: Components are PascalCase, hooks `use*`, services camelCase. Consistent.
- **Props Typing**: Props interfaces declared per component; some tests mock imports directly rather than using abstractions.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Standardize prop interface naming (`ComponentNameProps`).
  - Introduce `index.ts` barrel files in component folders for simpler imports.

## 3. State Management & Hooks

- **Local State**: Uses React `useState` and custom hooks (`useUndoRedo`, `useTheme`).
- **Custom Hooks Scope**: Hooks encapsulate logic but some contain mixed responsibilities (e.g., `useTheme` also manipulates CSS classes).
- **Opportunities**:
  - Extract theming logic into a separate service for clearer separation.
  - Add unit tests for custom hooks to improve coverage.

## 4. Services & API Layer

- **Modularity**: API and storage services in `src/services` follow single responsibility.
- **Error Handling**: Some services (e.g., `fileService`) lack consistent error wrapping.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Consolidate repeated error patterns into a shared error helper.
  - Interface definitions for external APIs to improve type safety.

## 5. Styling with Tailwind CSS

- **Utility-First**: Classes used directly in JSX; common patterns use component-specific style files in `src/styles`.
- **Theme Configuration**: `tailwind.config.cjs` aligns with project branding; `theme.ts` exports custom color palette.
- **Consistency**: Variations in spacing and color class usage; some inline styles appear in components.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Create component-level style conventions (e.g., define reusable className constants).
  - Enforce adding new patterns to `styles/` instead of inline.
  - Run a Tailwind linter plugin to catch dead or inconsistent class names.

## 6. TypeScript & Typing

- **Strict Mode**: `tsconfig.json` uses strict settings.
- **Global Types**: Additional types in `global.d.ts` and `types/` folder.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Remove `any` usage in `runA11y` and other test helpers.
  - Leverage `unknown` and refine types where appropriate.

## 7. Testing & Coverage

- **Coverage Gaps**: Many code paths in services, hooks, and components lack tests. Global coverage is at ~40%.
- **Test Patterns**: Uses Jest with React Testing Library; some tests directly import Jest globals instead of `@jest/globals` methods.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Standardize test imports (`import { describe, it, expect } from '@jest/globals'`).
  - Add tests for services and hooks; start with critical utility functions.

## 8. Accessibility & ARIA

- **Axe Integration**: Playwright-axe setup covers core pages.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Few `aria-` attributes used directly; rely on semantic elements.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Audit custom components for ARIA roles and labels.
  - Enforce accessible patterns in component library (e.g., modals, inputs).

## 9. Code Style & Linting

- **ESLint & Prettier**: Configured with Airbnb style and Prettier integration.
- **Lint Warnings**: No warnings allowed; all code must pass lint and format checks.
- **Opportunities**:
  - Add stylistic conventions for import ordering (e.g., alphabetical groups).
  - Use ESLint plugin for Tailwind to enforce class order.

## 10. Recommendations Summary

1. Introduce `pages/` structure for top-level views.
2. Add barrel files for cleaner imports in `components/`.
3. Consolidate theming logic into a dedicated service.
4. Increase test coverage by targeting services and hooks.
5. Standardize test imports and remove legacy mock patterns.
6. Enforce Tailwind linting and create reusable style utilities.
7. Review ARIA usage and enforce accessibility best practices.
8. Refine TypeScript types to eliminate `any` and strengthen safety.
9. Implement import ordering rules in ESLint.
10. Clean up overlapping directories (`motion/` vs `rendering/`).
